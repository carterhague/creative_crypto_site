    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Password cracking is the process of recovering unknown passwords from data that has been stored or transmitted by a computer system. A common approach is to repeatedly try guesses for the password and to check them against an available
      cryptographic hash of the password.
      More common methods of password cracking, such as dictionary attacks, pattern checking, word list substitution, etc. attempt to reduce the number of trials required and will usually be attempted before brute force. Higher password bit strength
      exponentially increases the
      number of candidate passwords that must be checked, on average, to recover the password and reduces the likelihood that the password will be found in any cracking dictionary.</p>
    <h1>Applications</h1>
    <p>The purpose of password cracking might be to help a user recover a forgotten password, to gain unauthorized access to a system, or to act as a preventive measure where system administrators check for easily crackable passwords. Password cracking is mostly used to gain unauthorized access to systems.</p>
    <h1>Practical Example: WPA2-PSK</h1>
    <p>Considering you are viewing this webpage, probably from an internet connected device, you have most likely used WiFi at some point in your life. As of 2020 WPA and WPA2 are two security methods supported universally by wireless acces points and the devices that connect to them. WPA and WPA2 are similar in protocol, but WPA2 is much more common. Both protocols have security vulnerabilites.</p>
    <p>Have you ever wanted to know the WiFi password for a network that you can't join?</p>
    <p>Well lets see how to crack that password. Below is a diagram of the WPA2-PSK 4-way handshake (STA: Station, AP: Access Point).</p>
    <img class="basicimage" src="images/4-way-handshake.jpg">
    <p><br>As you can see, the Station constructs the pairwise transient key(PTK) from ANonce, SNonce, and the pairwise master key(PMK - > derived from the WiFi password as a hash). After this constrution, the Station sends the AP a message integrity code(pretty much a keyed hash using the PTK).</p>
    <p>To recover the WiFi password we need to observe this unencrypted handshake. Then, all we have to do is guess at what the password is, and derive the PSK and PMK, to compute candidates for the PTK, and eventually the MIC. If all of these computed values match the observed handshake communications, we know that we have the password.</p>
    <p>All in all, password recovery comes down to trying out different passwords, computing intermediate values, and checking if those values match what you expect. If they do, you win.</p>
